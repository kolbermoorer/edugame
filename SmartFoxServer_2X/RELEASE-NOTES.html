	<h3>&raquo; What's new </h3>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Server Side</strong>
      <ul>
   	    <li>NEW: Improved thread management and scalability via AutoScaling-ThreadPools. The new system renders obsolete the previous manual configuration of System and Extension Controller threads. The AutoScaling-ThreadPool automatically detects higher loads and balances the number of threads and the queue size to handle increasing amounts of workload. The new thread pool are fully configurable in each and every detail although the default settings should cover a large number of scenarios.</li>
   	    <li>NEW: Jetty 9.x replaces old Jetty 6.x offering improved performance, support for servlet api 3.0 and HTTPS support out of the box</li>
   	    <li>NEW: BlueBox v. 3.0: revamped and improved edition compatible with the latest Jetty 9</li>
   	    <li>NEW: HTTP Uploads API with new server side event to manage the uploaded files</li>
   	    <li>NEW: Added support for websockets over SSL (WSS)</li>
   	    <li>NEW: Added support for Scala 2.10</li>
   	    <li>NEW: Added VARIABLES_MAP key for server side events such as USER_VARIABLES_UPDATE, ROOM_VARIABLES_UPDATE, BUDDY_VARIABLES_UPDATE. The value from this key is a Map of Variables.</li>
   	    <li>NEW:  SignUp component now allows re-sending of activation email in a later session and activation of the account in a later session.</li>

Also, HTTP and HTTPS ports can now be configured from within the Admin Tool itself (no need to edit the Jetty configuration manually anymore).</li>
	  <li>NEW: New settings added to the &quot;HTML5 WebSockets&quot; tab in Server Configurator module, now supporting SSL encryption activation.</li>
